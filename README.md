# pytool
a tool, sort of like a game engine, that should help writing small 2d(or maybe 3d in the future?) games

it provides the user an App class, which has start() and update() functions that are called from the tool
the engine has no objects, like unity, it only has the tool that runs update() and start() functions and a renderer where you add sprites, textures or UI elements like buttons
